# Employee Management System

This Python-based application is designed to manage employee records efficiently. It provides functionalities to add, update, delete, and display employee information. The application uses a SQLite database to store data and Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI).

## Features

- **Add New Employees**: Enter details such as name, age, job title, email, gender, contact number, and address to add a new employee.
- **Update Employee Details**: Modify the existing employee records.
- **Delete Employees**: Remove an employee from the database.
- **Display All Employees**: View all employee records in a tabular format.
- **User Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface built with Tkinter, including form fields, buttons, and a treeview for displaying data.
- **Data Persistence**: Employee records are stored in a SQLite database (`Employees.db`).

## Technologies Used

- **Tkinter**: For creating the graphical user interface.
- **SQLite**: To store and manage employee data.
- **PIL (Python Imaging Library)**: For processing and displaying images (e.g., logo).
